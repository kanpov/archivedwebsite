## About me

I've been a programmer since 2020 with a focus in game development and Minecraft modding.

This website is dedicated to storing some content I put out online:

- A **newsletter** that I put out every Sunday at 6PM GMT (or earlier)
- Some **articles** about my personal experiences
- A repository of my **projects** with links to their respective [GitHub](https://github.com/RedGrapefruit09)
  repositories
- My **Maven** repository for distributing the artifacts of my JVM libraries

I'd consider myself somewhat of a generalist, and my other interests include:

- Journaling with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Learning English
- Learning German
- Writing articles
- Maintaining an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) collection of flashcards
- Competitive programming, mostly [WorldSkills](https://worldskills.com)
