## About me

I've been a programmer since 2020 with a focus in game development and Minecraft modding.

I'd consider myself somewhat of a generalist, and my other interests include:

- Journaling with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- Learning English
- Learning German
- Writing articles
- Maintaining an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) collection of flashcards
- Competitive programming, mostly [WorldSkills](https://worldskills.com)
