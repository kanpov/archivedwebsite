### Introduction

- This week has been one of the most important ones in a long while, ever since WorldSkills finale
- As promised, I've started my path to becoming a 3D game development by going into multiple directions at once:
  - 3D graphics in [Blender](https://blender.org)
  - Enhancing my problem-solving skills
  - Algebra and geometry
- I unfortunately can't provide any update on the ResourceRun project from the past three weeks, as I haven't been
  working on it at all this week
  - The plan is to resume work and finish the basic game version (v0.3) once I have a bit more time
  - With that in mind, I'd say the (approximate and indefinite) release date for the game is late June this year
- I won't write a section about language learning this time either
  - Though, I'm planning to make a section combining the two weeks of progress next time (in 0.5)
- Even though this post may seem underwhelming compared to the volume of the previous ones, my summer holidays have just
  begun, and I now have a lot of time to make progress

### 3D graphics

- As mentioned in the last section and in 0.3, I'm using [Blender](https://blender.org) for my 3D needs for a few reasons:
  - It's completely free and [open source](https://github.com/blender)
  - It has an enormous community and, as a result, a huge amount of learning resources
  - It's supported in both WorldSkills and [NTO](https://ntcontest.ru)
- First, to follow tradition, I completed the 
  [Donut tutorial for 3.x](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD)
  - Though, not the full thing, only episodes up until animation
  - I might come back to it later if I need to
  - I'd give the tutorial series a 3/5-star rating, it was definitely helpful, but quite confusing in many places for a
    beginner
- Here are three of my final renders:

![Normal view of the donut]({% link cdn/20220529/DonutNormalView.png %})
- After completing this part of the series, I learnt how to navigate around the UI and viewport
  and a bit of rendering, sculpting and modeling
- Still, that was not nearly enough to make something of my own, so I searched for another tutorial specifically about
  modeling
- After a while, I stumbled upon a great tutorial about creating an
  [isometric bedroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHT23A6aJA)
  - It was a blast to follow, and I learned a lot of the essential modeling tools in Blender
  - By the end of the tutorial, I achieved this result:

- Next week, I'm planning on practicing more on this design and proceeding onto the second and more difficult

### Problem-solving

- I've begun learning C++ using a course on [Stepik](https://stepik.org)
- I first picked up a complicated course that was pretty difficult and a bit too technical
- So, when I was at around 15% completion, I switched to an easier introductory course that teaches base language
  concepts
- There are a few reasons that I've started learning C++, even though I'll be using Unity with C#:
  - It's a useful skill in general
  - It'll come in handy if I decide to switch to Unreal Engine 5
  - It's a perfect platform for enhancing my problem-solving skills on platforms like [Stepik](https://stepik.org)
    and [CodeWars](https://codewars.com)
- I only began doing this on the weekend, so I don't have much to show off just yet
- I've just finished the three basic sections (intro, basic syntax and arithmetics), but I'm looking forward to investing
  more time in this next week

### Mathematics

- On the weekend, I also started learning mathematics, as it's definitely a skill that'll come in handy eventually
- Also don't have to show much for it (most of the week I was solely modeling in my spare 1.5 hours after school):
  - Started the 7th grade algebra program on some revising
  - Started revising fundamental geometry
