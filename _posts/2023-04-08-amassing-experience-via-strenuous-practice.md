## Preface

- Due to an incredibly busy holiday period in February, I was entirely unable to write a new post in spite of the
  massive amount of work I'd been able to show off even then.
- So, I've finally reappeared out of obscurity after more than 3 months since the release of NL1.14 and am ready to show
  off the 5 large multi-week projects that I have completed since January.
  - My journey towards learning 3D has taken various unexpected (and incredibly time-consuming) twists and turns in the
    past couple of months.
  - My work has morphed from the single-week small ventures that I showed off in the last post into large monolithic
    projects that each consume 2-4 weeks of active development time.
