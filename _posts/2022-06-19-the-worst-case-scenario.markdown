### Language Learning

- This week we've been working on [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0), _How to learn any
  language in 6 months_
- Once again, we discussed the useful and not-so applicable parts of the talk; to summarize - nothing worth commenting on
- Another topic popped up during the discussion about my current level of English
  - It's something I've been thinking about a lot in the past months as my skills advanced further with the creation of
    this newsletter and the analyses I've been doing
  - I pretty much know the language at a reasonably advanced level, which is more than enough for my current needs
  - However, as long as I am able to take the lessons, which help me practice, maintain and improve that level, I am going
    to continue doing so
- Next time, I'm going to present the script for my own TED talk, which I'm quite concerned about; going to be a lot of
  writing practice
- For German, I don't have much to talk about, as we've only finished the last micro-topic of the current Unit and did
  various tests and exercises

### 3D Graphics

- I've finished the series of rooms I've been chipping away at ever since NL0.4 (NL - newsletter) with the most complicated
  room of them all - the kitchen
  - It has a lot more non-cubic shapes, which require various deformations of the geometry to be made
  - It took the most time of all the rooms: 4 days
  - Nevertheless, the modeling was successful, and the lighting and materials were decent
  - The first image below is my result, the second one is the reference which I used for making the scene:

- After a brief search, I decided to use [3DGreenhorn](https://www.youtube.com/c/3DGreenhorn)'s fast
  [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0t8o5_UDu0FbhWEhQthAol93Hi2LvwJj)
  - After completing all of 3DGreenhorn's room projects (3 of them on my own), I had a decent grasp of the basics of
    Blender and wanted to improve further
  - This series shows off more advanced scenes with more complicated shapes in short, sped-up timelapse videos
- The first video I picked was a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgP_uAAFwlc&list=PL0t8o5_UDu0FbhWEhQthAol93Hi2LvwJj&index=7)
  about making a scene with a water-tank
  - New techniques learned:
    - Using the _Solidify_ modifier instead of the _Extrude_ tool
    - Bridging faces during modeling
    - Using the _Bevel_ tool (not the modifier) for thickening edges
    - Bridging edge loops to create holes inside the mesh
    - Using ico-spheres for making trees and rocks
  - The first image shows my first render made after following the tutorial and then my second render, for which
    I completely replicated the former project (to practice through repetition):

- The second video, which I have started working on, is a
 [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waRfT1TF1oE&list=PL0t8o5_UDu0FbhWEhQthAol93Hi2LvwJj&index=11) 
 on making a scene with a beacon and light house
  - New techniques learned:
    - Modeling with a circle as a base
    - Bezier circle curves in combination with the _Curve_ and _Array_ modifiers to loop an object around a curve
    - Beveling in combination with the _Subdivision Surface_ modifier to add support loops
    - The _Wireframe_ modifier to create a frame around an object
    - _Alt+D_-type duplication
    - Deformed (with Proportional Editing) ico-spheres to create rocks
    - Meta-balls to create clouds
    - Glass materials in combination with an inner emissive material to create glowing surfaces
    - Using a smoothed-out plane as the background
  - Here's the render I made from following along with the tutorial (currently working on the recreation):

### Algebra

- In terms of algebra, I've been productive this week and finished almost two major sections of the curriculum:
  - Monomials (the product of numbers and unknown values):
    - The definition of a monomial
    - The standard representation of a monomial
    - Addition and subtraction of monomials
    - Multiplying and exponentiating monomials
    - Dividing monomials
  - Polynomials (the algebraic sum of one or multiple monomials):
    - The definition of a polynomial and their standard representation
    - Addition and subtraction
    - Multiplying a polynomial by a monomial
    - Multiplying a polynomial by another polynomial
- This totals in almost 75% of the entire curriculum for 7th grade algebra, which is a large achievement for me

### Geometry

- As mentioned in the last three posts, I've been going through an unconventional textbook for learning geometry,
 which goes over the fundamentals instead of focusing on the theorems
- I'm going to study the official curriculum eventually, but, for now, I've decided to solely focus on it
- Since there's not much to show, I decided to just publish a list of paragraphs I've gone through this week:
  - P6. "Broken" lines
  - P7. Polygons
  - P8. Triangles
  - P9. Quads or quadrangles
  - P10. Polyhedrons (3D shapes, essentially)
- As you may see, this knowledge is not only helpful for geometry, but also for 3D graphics, as it improves my understanding
 of the fundamentals

### Competitive Programming

- As a long term goal, I've decided to try to participate in various other competitive programming olympiads
  - Most notably, [NTO](https://ntcontest.ru) VR, which I see as a successor of WorldSkills due to various objective benefits
    - Unfortunately, I can't participate in it until I enter the 8th grade, so that's only going to be in 2023-2024
    - Though, that gives me more time to prepare
  - I might participate in WorldSkills again in the VR section as a stepping stone to NTO
  - Another less VR-oriented option is [VOS](https://vos.olimpiada.ru), which is a solely mathematic and algorithmic olympiad
- Because of the situation that has formed ever since the 24th of February, I might not be able to act on my original plan of going
 to study in Germany (which is what I've been learning German for)
  - Due to the specifics of my country's education system, there's essentially a final test after school, which determines whether
   you'll be able to go to university and get any sort of decent job
  - To ensure that I can pass this test in the worst-case scenario, I can participate in various olympiads, which adds a certain
   number of points to the total test score
  - And this is one of the benefits of NTO and VOS: NTO adds 100 points (equivalent to the max amount of points for a single subject, and there's
   only 3-4 of them) and a win in the top tour of VOS will pass you immediately
  - As much as it would be disappointing to have to resort to this option, I have to account for every scenario just to be safe
- On this dissatisfying note, I'd like to end this status update. I hope to be able to provide a larger update on my preparation efforts next time
