## Preface

- My absence has lasted over 2 months now, with no posts on the website and commits on the
  [public project repository](https://github.com/kanpov/Blender_Public).
  - The main reason for this radio silence is my lack of time that is necessary to put up a quality newsletter post
    summarizing the large number of events that have happened since late September.
  - As more and more things happened, my workflow had to be reconstructed over and over again, with no hint of actual
    stability in sight.
  - With this, the amount of stuff I'd have to summarize in the next post grew overtime, making it less and less
    feasible to write it in the near-term.
- Now that I finally have a week off my studies, I can finally get back to posting in the newsletter more regularly.
- My utter neglect of journaling for these past 2 months has resulted in losing track of the large chain of events that
  has happened since, hence why I've been yearning to return.
- This post will go over all that's happened in a semi-chronological order, and from here onwards I'll try my
  best to write these updates in a more regular manner.

## Studying Competitive Programming

- As partially mentioned in NL1.12, I successfully applied to prepare for programming and English olympiads and began 
  studying shortly after the post's release.
- I won't elaborate much about the English preparation program, as I dropped it only after 1.5 months since I started.
  - My main reason behind this decision was that the program was trying to teach a level of proficiency that was miles
    behind what I've already achieved, and I deemed it pointless to persevere.
- A larger driving factor was, in fact, the programming course which aided me immensely in advancing my competitive
  programming (algorithmic) knowledge.
  - The format of the course was simple: every week, a new set of tasks is published, at least the predominant part of
    which we have to complete during the week.
  - The tasks are of varying difficulty, ranging from relatively simple to mind-bogglingly complex and are hosted on a
    private platform with an automated code testing system.
  - At the end of each week we have a lesson where we either ask for feedback and work further on the tasks or a new set
    of tasks is introduced alongside a new topic to master.
  - Even though my performance was in most cases noticeably above average, I still had a tough time working on the tasks
    , and it was a rather time-consuming activity.
- I earned my first practical experience with olympiads when I was invited to the city's team programming olympiad:
  - I assembled a half-decent team consisting of me and two 9-th graders who practically came up to me asking to join
    after looking at my results in the course.
  - The actual olympiad consisted of 10 tasks ranging from bearable to absolutely cursed (for our level) difficulty,
    which weren't even grouped for different grades.
    - E.g. any 6-th grader was given the same level of tasks of an 11-th grader with extensive experience in the field,
      which absolutely diminishes any chances of beginners like us getting anywhere.
  - The time limit of 4.25 hours at first glance might seem excessive, but for this level of tasks it was a tight
    constraint.
  - In spite of the challenges we faced, we managed to complete 4 out of the 10 tasks and got plenty of experience out
    of that somewhat questionable endeavor.

## The School Tour of VOS

- VOS is the primary initiative for competitive programming and any other olympiads where I live, and in late October
  CPM wanted our relatively inexperienced group to participate in the school tour.
  - Through a suspiciously unregulated loophole, even 7-th graders like me were able to participate in the olympiad
    which is intended for 9-11th graders.
  - Participating in the olympiad for my grade was entirely pointless, as it was more of a logic exercise than an actual
    programming competition.
- I took a day of school in order to have enough time allocated in order to participate in order to avoid disrupting my
  studies, however problems quickly arose:
  - The biggest problem was the fact that the entire testing system was down from the sheer amount of participants that
    were overloading the (potentially underfunded) servers.
  - This essentially meant that I had to write the entire olympiad effectively blind, as I was completely unable to see
    how my code submissions performed.
    - To clarify, testing my submissions on my own machine was infeasible since the entire test suite of a programming
      task is always hidden in such competitions.
    - Only a tiny amount of test cases are provided to test against, which, in such circumstances, can easily provide a
      false sense of relief when, in reality, the program fails to work for any non-trivial test cases.
  - Nevertheless, I did everything that was in my power in order to do as well as I could, but even so many of my
    submissions were entirely ignored thanks to a new package of glitches and failures in the flawed competition system.
- After a frustrating amount of miscommunication from the organizers' end, they announced an extra day for us to solve
  a similar set of problems all over again.
  - Thankfully, this time around the testing system worked fine, and I experienced no major issues overall.
    - This was most likely due to the organizers making it remarkably difficult to apply for access to the extra day 
      (and failing to meet their own service standards).
  - My general performance was much better, and the tasks seemed noticeably less frustrating, so after another 2
    competition hours, I managed to get a fairly high result of 460 out of 500 points.
- For my first attempt at competing in VOS, I think I did reasonably well.
- Afterwards, I was invited to a private event hosted by CPM to prepare for the next tour of VOS that is taking place on
  December the 11th.
  - This next tour will be hosted in-person and regulated more, but I'm going to try my best nevertheless, though I
    doubt I'll have any chances in the city tour, since it actually requires extensive knowledge of algorithms (which
    I do not yet possess).
  - The preparation event consisted of 5 marathon-like days, where we received a set of tasks largely taken from past
    municipal tours in the morning, went through them and watched a breakdown of the various approaches you could take
    to solving them.
  - This was a reasonably productive way to prepare for the tour, though my studies were hindered somewhat due to me
    having to take a few days off.

## Returning to WorldSkills

- As largely detailed in NL1.12, I've been meaning to return to WorldSkills for quite some time, though under a new
  competency as a 3D artist.
- The actual competition is being heavily reformed at the moment, hence why there was a noticeable delay before the
  invites rolled around and preparation began.
- As a result, there's still a fair amount of headroom to prepare until the competitive rounds begin (which I doubt is
  going to happen before late January/February of next year), and I've been trying to use this time to go along their
  study program as effectively as possible.
- Without delving into an excessive amount of detail, the work format (for now) is this: we receive a hefty assignment
  every Saturday/Sunday and work on it (be it following along a tutorial video, or making something on our own),
  submitting our results at the end of the week.
- What will follow is a relatively brief summary of the first three weeks of preparation (the fourth week has only just
  begun, so it's a topic for another time), consisting primarily of screenshots of my results.

### Week I

- The first part of the assignment was a beginner tutorial series on creating a pretty detailed scene:

- Next up was a tiny tutorial about making an extremely minimalistic handheld gaming console:

- A more exciting endeavor was this small sandy beach scene:

- A smaller project was this tiny island:

- Overall, a hefty amount of projects as an introduction to the software.

### Week II

- Week II was entirely dedicated to a large tutorial series about modeling a high-poly detailed revolver from this
  blueprint:

- Only the videos lasted for about 4 hours, so it took me an unreasonable amount of time to replicate the tutorials and
  end up with the following result:
![The side orthographic view of the revolver](/cdn/20221120/Week2SideView.png)
![The front perspective view of the revolver](/cdn/20221120/Week2FrontView.png)
- After the surprisingly not-so-challenging (yet somewhat mundane at times) process of modeling the revolver, I realized
  that high-polygon models are not as difficult to make as I had considered them to be.

### Week III

- Unlike the preceding preparation weeks, where the main goal was following along a certain tutorial or a series of
  tutorials, week III was dedicated to practice.
- The task was to model a handheld light of your choosing that has as much detail as possible.
- After roaming around the Internet for a good (and challenging) fit, I settled on this mass-produced model:

- After only a few days of work, I ended up with this result:

## The Future

- In the future, I'm going to try to write these posts more regularly, but with the sheer amount of work I've committed
  to, it's challenging to see how a schedule more frequent than monthly posts is in any way feasible.
- Preparing for WorldSkills is hardly an easy task, and the farther I get, the larger the time toll it takes on me and
  my physical and mental health.
  - Nevertheless, I'm confident that if I was able to go through this cycle once, I'll be able to repeat my success this
    time around.
- As soon as I have enough to show off and the confidence that such a showcase meets the standards I've set for this
  newsletter, a follow-up will be released.
