### Introduction

- My studies are finally over, so I'm pretty much working full-time now and for most of the summer
- I'll likely go on a vacation late June - early August, though I might also be able to work a little then
- This week has pretty been a transition into the new schedule, so I don't think I've reached peak productivity yet
- Plus, I briefly went away on the weekend, so that hindered the progress insignificantly

### English

#### Week One

- The TED talk we worked with is available [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/isaac_lidsky_what_reality_are_you_creating_for_yourself)
- It is about the subjective reality our brain produces, what it is composed of and how to bend that reality to your needs
- I'd recommend giving it a watch, but I personally think it has little to no practical value, at least for me
- I made some relatively extensive notes in a few days as preparation and presented it on the lesson, nothing
  particularly interesting

#### Week Two

- The second TED [talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_harford_a_powerful_way_to_unleash_your_natural_creativity/)
  was much more interesting and actually practical
- It addresses common misconceptions about multitasking, how and why it should be applied
- Multitasking is a highly relevant topic for me, as I've got endless concurrent activities, especially nowadays, and
 it's going to be a part of the productivity article series I'm planning to write sometime
- I wrote a decently-sized text (4 A4 pages) that is somewhat of a hybrid between an article and an analysis
  - I reformatted the exercises I had been given into a structured kind of article with headings and linked topics
  - I'm currently considering publishing this analysis and my future works on this website, might provide an update on
    that next week
  - The regular exercises I put into a separate private file not to mess with the structure
- On the lesson I gave a decent presentation of the analysis, and we had a pretty productive discussion

### German

- It's often really demotivating to review my progress in learning German in comparison with my English skills
  - Though, to be fair I've learned a lot in these past 8 months from absolutely zero skills in the language
- Anyway, these past two weeks we've been working on the 8th Unit
- Units in this book are pretty much divided each into 2 to 4 micro-units, each with new vocabulary and some also
  accompanied by new grammar
- Unit 8 had three micro-units:
  - City outdoors: roads, crossings, passengers and shops
  - Entertainment with the example of Mini-MÃ¼nchen, a popular German hobby program for kids
  - Food in cafe-s and restaurants
- I've finished all of the above and also dedicated a whole lesson to dialogue about ordering food from restaurants,
  which is undoubtedly an important topic
- Neither the grammar nor the vocabulary for this Unit were particularly challenging

### 3D graphics

- I developed a strategy of how to properly use 3D tutorials in a non-addicting way
  - The main problem with just binging through tutorials and following along every single one is that you get addicted
    to that method of learning and are not able to create something of your own
  - To combat this issue, I developed a three-try system of learning:
    - On the first try, follow along the tutorial and try to understand the author's actions instead of blindly copying
      them over to your `.blend` file
    - On the second try, create a completely new project, add a new pane to the editor with your rendered image from the
      first try and recreate it as much as possible without looking at the tutorial
    - On the third try, repeat the aforementioned step without any help
  - The amount of tries varies depending on the situation and the complexity of the tutorial, but you get the general
    idea of it
- I applied this methodology on the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCHT23A6aJA), the render from which I
  presented last time
  - It took me two attempts to completely understand it, so I left it with a basic understanding of modeling
- The next tutorial to enhance my modeling skills was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEGJeVnWZAA) by the
  same author as the last one
  - It is a longer and more complicated tutorial divided into 3 separate videos (browse their channel to find the other
    parts)
  - It's similar to the last one, as it covers the creation of another isometric room: a living room
  - Despite the style being the same, the room involves more difficult and rounded shapes, such as donuts and more
    visually appealing plants
  - It took me two days to finish it and another three days to redo it two times
- Here is the result (definitely a step up from the last room):

- For the remaining few days of the week, I decided to start my first original project
  - The inspiration for it was 3DGreenhorn's [paid course](https://3dgreenhorn.gumroad.com/l/stylizedrooms) about
    creating such stylized rooms
  - The free part of it was the above-mentioned room
  - Even though I'm unable to buy it, there's a reference image on the promo page with a combined render of all four
    rooms:
![4 rendered images of rooms combined into one](/cdn/20220606/CombinedRoomReferences.png)
  - I figured creating the three other rooms on my own based off of this image's splits would be great practice
  - I settled on the bedroom as the first project since it was the simplest in terms of shapes. Here's how it's going to
    look:

  - Here's a sneak-peek of the progress:

### Programming

- I've continued learning C++ in the spare time I had from maths and 3D
- The course is quite challenging and has various sophisticated exercises to test understanding of the subject
- Unfortunately, I can't show off anything else than a status report: (it's just been a lot of coding practice)
  - [x] Basic arithmetics
  - [x] Conditional statements
  - [x] `while` loops
  - [x] Decimal arithmetic
  - [x] `for` loops
  - [x] Arrays in the form of `std::vector`s (thankfully, this course doesn't teach the useless C arrays)
  - [x] 2D arrays / matrices
  - [ ] (_WIP_) Functions and recursion
  - [ ] Strings and symbols
  - [ ] Dictionaries (maps) and sets
  - [ ] STL algorithms
- Even though most of the topics are quite simple, the exercises range from outputting the last digit of a number to
  creating exotic matrices (spirals, diagonals etc.) and advanced algebra (logarithms, systems of equations)
- It's been painful at times to go through this course, but I've passed a lot of it
- Next week I'm going to be focusing less on the programming side of things, and more on 3D and maths

### Mathematics

- Also, not the most exciting subject to cover, but I've still got a small update:
  - I've been slowly going through fundamental geometry with a decent book
  - I've also continued going through 7th grade algebra with these topics:
    - Coordinate lines
    - The coordinate plane (essentially 2D space on `x` and `y`), coordinates (XY)
    - The linear equation `ax+by+c=0` and its graph
    - The linear function `y=kx+m` and its graph
    - The linear function `y=kx` and its properties and graph
  - I've got to say, this has been really difficult to understand, probably I'm just rushing it too much
