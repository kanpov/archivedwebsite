## Preface

- Admittedly, it's been quite a while since the release of the last post, almost exactly a month, in fact.
- I have many reasons to back such a lack of activity on the website, most of which I predicted when writing NL1.11
  back in late August.
- Most importantly, the start of the school year introduced a workload significantly heavier than anticipated.
  - This (on average) reduced my free work hours from 40-50 during this summer to around 8-10, causing my ability to
    work on any of my active initiatives to suddenly plummet.
  - For the first two weeks, I had to halt almost all work on my projects because I was getting caught up in trying
    to adapt to the new 7-6-6-6-6-5 lesson week and barely managed to scrape up 4-5 hours per week.
  - Only after getting used to the new workload was I able to establish an adequate work standard comparable to about
    40-50% of what I'd been able to do back in May.
- However, I'm getting top-notch maths classes in school (algebra, geometry, statistics, probability theory and more),
  which will definitely come in handy in any 3D-related sphere, so I'm still getting a ton out of it.
- As of recently, I've managed to get a decent level of stability across my routine and have managed to accumulate
  enough to show off to even write this post.

## Change of Direction

- The past few weeks have introduced a significant change in direction that will likely influence my activity for the
  next several years (if the world doesn't, let's just say, flip upside down again).
- Firstly, I'd like to briefly summarize what I've been doing since 2020:
  - In late 2020, I got into modding Minecraft and was able to put my decent programming skills to use that way.
  - Between September 2021 and April 2022, I participated in a professional game development tournament and acquired a
    ton of experience.
  - In late May 2022, I decided to start learning 3D game development alongside competitive programming and have been
    doing that ever since.
- Another complicated matter was my future after graduating from school, as there were two available options:
  - I could seek for a college in my country, but going somewhere even remotely decent would require extensive
    participation in various olympiads (hence my motivation for competitive programming).
  - I could try to immigrate to Germany via a college (hence why I've been learning German for a little over a year).
- However, due to recent circumstances, the latter option isn't reliable enough for the near future, so I need to have
  a backup plan sorted.
- So, I've been learning CP (competitive programming) on my own, but in early September I found out about an organization
  that is dedicated to training participants in CP and other olympiads.
  - I applied for two training programs: CP (informatics) and English, went through qualification rounds and passed on
    both.
  - Since I'm heavily above average at English, I figured I'd try that out as well, and it'd be great practice as I
    cancelled out on my former English tutoring.
  - The English lessons have already started, but CP hasn't yet, so I've decided to only elaborate on this when I have
    enough information to make an objective conclusion.

## German

- Since the last post, I've finished the A2 book and moved onto learning for the B1 level.
  - This is quite an achievement, especially since my first ever German lesson was in early September of last year, so
    I practically went up from zero to a solid introductory level in only a year.
  - I'm looking forward to seeing how far I can come in this year of learning.
- Because I already have somewhat of a foundation of my language knowledge, I decided to incorporate passive study
  alongside my biweekly schedule.
  - This hybrid method of study (as outlined in many of my articles) propelled me from a beginner in English to a
    considerable level of fluency in only about 2 years, hence why I believe it can work for German as well.
  - At this stage, I've only introduced reading (as I mentioned in some of my previous articles), and have tried to
    make reading in German a part of my daily routine.
  - However, as time goes on, I'll add more methods of passive study and use of the language.
- In terms of regular studying, I don't have much to show off, but I've of course been working on it as usual.

## 3D Castle

- I've got very little to show in terms of progress on my primary castle project, as the work on it has largely
  scrambled to a halt over the course of the past few weeks:
  - The project started out on a quick pace, and I managed to get the general layout of the castle (the center, inner
    and outer walls) done in under a week.
  - Things slowed down as I painstakingly searched for references and developed a modular collection of house parts
    as to create the housing inside the castle.
  - The same slow and somewhat boring process had to be performed again with even more variation to create the detailed
    marketplace in the castle front area.
  - At that point I was already getting quite fed up with working on this giant environment project, but the most
    mundane part was yet to come: the details.
    - After finishing the marketplace, the major task separating me from working on the materials, lighting and shading
      was decorating and detailing all parts of the castle.
    - These tiny details were trivial to model, but the worst part was actually placing them down for hours, hoping to
      get them to look just right.
    - I didn't want to use Geometry Nodes or a Particle System to automate the process, because I wanted to line up
      the pieces manually, which turned out to a huge mistake.
  - So my motivation completely died out, and I turned to my side project and halted all work on the castle for now.
- So, not much has changed about the castle since NL1.11 (aside from a repositioning of the marketplace tents):

## 3D Port Town

- The port town is a side project that I've been working on ever since late August and the finish of which was the main
  reason for this post's relatively early release.
- While I was browsing [Behance](https://behance.net) looking for a side project idea, I found this artwork by Yaroslav
  Adamov and decided to recreate it:
![The inspiration for my port town project](https://github.com/kanpov/Blender_Public/raw/main/20_PortTown/Reference.png)  
- First, I created the base port alongside the foundation and some decorations sprinkled in:
![Progress image 1](/cdn/20220919/PortTown1.png)
- Then, I recreated all buildings one by one, trying to replicate as much detail as possible:

![Progress image 3](/cdn/20220919/PortTown3.png)
![Progress image 4](/cdn/20220919/PortTown4.png)
- Afterwards, I added more decorations and smaller details to the scene:
![Progress image 5](/cdn/20220919/PortTown5.png)
- And after adding a camera, materials and lighting the scene I got this result:
![The final render with 30% compression](https://github.com/kanpov/Blender_Public/raw/main/20_PortTown/RenderCompressed.png)
- The image above even with 30% compression weighs ~17MB, because I rendered the scene in 4K to capture more detail and
  try out tiled rendering. To download the uncompressed highly detailed image, click
  [this link](https://github.com/kanpov/Blender_Public/raw/main/20_PortTown/Render.png).
- To be fair, my result still looks noticeably worse than the original, primarily due to my inexperience in good
  lighting and shading, but I'm still proud of what I've managed to accomplish with this project.
- Once again I'd like to reiterate that this was not an original project, so full credit goes to 
  [Yaroslav Adamov](https://www.behance.net/YaroslavAdamov) for designing the original scene.
