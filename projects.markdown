## My mods

I've made several mods for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) using the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) toolchain:

- **[JustEnoughGems](https://github.com/kanpov/JustEnoughGems)**: a mod that adds tons of new
  gems and content related to them
- **[Cryonic](https://github.com/kanpov/Cryonic)**: a plugin for the famous
  [Croptopia](https://https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/croptopia-fabric) mod making everything more
  realistic
- **[MoreMetals](https://github.com/kanpov/MoreMetals)**: adds a lot of new armor and tools with special
  effects
- **[GoldenForge](https://github.com/kanpov/GoldenForge)** _(work-in-progress)_: adds a realistic metallurgy
  process to Minecraft and everything associated with it

## My modding libraries

I've also been focused a bunch on creating modding libraries/APIs:

- **[Arctree](https://github.com/kanpov/Arctree)**: adds a neat overlay API to creating trees in Minecraft,
  providing lots of extra features. Has Kotlin extensions
- **[ItemNBT3](https://github.com/kanpov/ItemNBT)**: a huge API for serializing & deserializing data for your
  mods in NBT form in a much more developer-friendly way
- **[BetterNBT](https://github.com/kanpov/BetterNBT)** _(experimental)_: a less bloated version of ItemNBT
  only for Kotlin developers. Hasn't been entirely tested yet
- **[DataPipe](https://github.com/kanpov/DataPipe)**: a Kotlin-only abstraction over custom
  resource-pack/data-pack
  data for your mods, providing much-needed security measures with the lazy-handle mechanism
- **[RedMenu](https://github.com/kanpov/RedMenu)**: a library for sharing often duplicated code for creating
  menu blocks (with `Screen`s and `ScreenHandler`s). Also supports [LibGUI](https://github.com/CottonMC/LibGUI).
- **[FabricRegistrar](https://github.com/kanpov/FabricRegistrar)**: a dynamic registration library for Kotlin
  Fabric mods

## My games

I haven't released any games yet, the reason for that being that most of my knowledge stems from
**competitive game development**.

Though, I've been working on a few new projects recently, and I'm looking forward to announcing some new releases
sometime in the second half of 2022.
