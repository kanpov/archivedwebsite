## Introduction

If you've ever wanted to learn a foreign language, then you've gone through the painful process of learning vocabulary.

The prevalent method of teaching vocabulary in schools has always been inefficient: you get a block of new vocabulary
and grind through the words for hours in the evening, desperately trying to smash the words into your brain. And even
after doing so, you'll most likely forget everything after the test and have to relearn them again in a few weeks.

Spaced repetition is a scientifically-proven technique of remembering any sort of information that aims to address these
concerns and make learning more efficient. In this article I'm going to explain what it is in detail and how to make it
more scalable throughout your language learning process.

## What is Spaced Repetition?

### Active Recall Testing

Active recall testing is a simple term that means being asked a question and trying to remember the answer, e.g.
_recalling_ the answer. This is in contrast to passive study, where we read, watch, or listen to something without
pausing to consider if we know the answer. Both methods have their uses in language learning, as will be explained
later.

You have probably encountered active recall testing in school without knowing the term. When your teachers give you a
series of questions to answer after introducing some new material, or make you take tests, they are doing it so as to
increase the chances that you will be able to recall that information in the future.

### "Use It or Lose It"

Our brains are highly efficient and tend to rapidly discard information that doesn't seem useful. The brain's
"use it or lose it" policy applies to everything we learn. If you spend an afternoon memorizing some science terms, and
then don't think about that material for two weeks, you'll probably have forgotten most of it. And this can become
daunting when you need to study large amounts of information.

The solution to this is to review the material that you've learnt every once in a while. By doing so, you will be able
to greatly reduce how often you forget the material that you were trying to learn.

### The Spacing Effect

The spacing effect was first discovered by a German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885. He observed that we tend to
remember information much better when we spread out reviews over a certain period of time instead of studying multiple
times in a single learning session.

Since then, learners have attempted to utilize this effect to improve the learning process, which is even more relevant
for language vocabulary. This application of the spacing effect is called "spaced repetition" and the techniques that
put it into practice are called spaced repetition systems (SRS).

Now that you understand what spaced repetition is on its own, we'll discuss the two dominant branches of it: explicit
and implicit spaced repetition.

## Explicit Spaced Repetition

The first and the most popular branch of spaced repetition are explicit spaced repetition systems. To understand the
evolution of explicit SRS-s, we need to look back at their history.

### Paper Boxes

One of the earliest attempts at an explicit SRS was made by a German scientist Sebastian Leitner, who used paper
flash-cards for memorization. He separated the cards containing the information he intended to memorize into a series
of boxes and moved them to different boxes depending on whether he managed to recall the information on the back of the
flashcard. By doing this, it is possible to get a rough estimate of how well a card was known and when it should be
reviewed again.

This was a huge improvement over a single box of cards that didn't retain this type of information that
can help to utilize the spacing effect. The main problems with this approach are that it doesn't give you the exact date
of the next review and dramatically loses its accuracy when paired with material of varying difficulty.

### SuperMemo

The biggest step to automating and improving this method came from the developers of a computer software called
SuperMemo. SuperMemo implemented a system that keeps track of the ideal time to review some material and optimizes
itself based on the user's performance and usage data. Every time you answer a question (e.g. are asked to remember
the contents of a given flashcard), you tell the program how well you remembered the answer and SuperMemo uses that
information to compute the perfect time to show the card to you again. Because your memory gets stronger over time
thanks to active recall testing, the intervals between card reviews get longer over time (from 1 day to 3, a week,
two weeks, a month and so on).

SuperMemo's scheduling algorithm was revolutionary for learning, as it meant that you could learn and retain information
with the absolute minimum effort necessary. Although, the program has been widely criticized for its unintuitive and
difficult to navigate user interface and glitches, and it only runs on Windows.  It is commercial software and the only
available free versions are irrelevant for modern needs.

### Anki

These issues have driven many to turn to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a free and open-source program with a more
user-friendly UI that works on all major operating systems. It also has a large collection of add-ons extending the
program's functionality with features like exporting your data and integrating external editors to make editing cards
more convenient. And, most importantly, it is much easier to use than SuperMemo and has a wide array of tutorials.

The aforementioned advantages have led to it becoming the dominant piece of software that implements an explicit SRS.
There are alternatives like [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) that are marketed better towards the average user, but are
highly inferior to Anki's optimized scheduling algorithm and prioritize a neat user interface and shiny features over
improving the underlying SRS.

## Implicit Spaced Repetition

Implicit spaced repetition and implicit SRS-s are driven by a technique called passive review, which is the exact
opposite of active recall that drives explicit SRS-s. It is when the material being learned is processed passively,
be it by reading a text or a book, watching a video or listening to a podcast.

Implicit spaced repetition expands on the concept of passively acquiring information by implementing the same principle
of reviewing information that is directly present in explicit SRS-s. For example, you might read a text and come back to
it again after 2 days, then 4, then 8, 16 days and so on (please note that this is not the only and most effective way
to implement reviews for an implicit SRS).

Implicit SRS-s have not been automated using computer software or any other universal method, since, unlike the
well-defined standard of an explicit SRS, their efficacy and review method depend on the preferences of the learner.

## Explicit vs Implicit SRS

Now that you've learned about explicit and implicit spaced repetition, the big question is which one to choose.

It's been scientifically proven that explicit SRS-s are more effective at getting information into your long-term
memory, but there are several downsides that become more and more apparent throughout your language learning process:

1. With explicit spaced repetition, the context of a word or expression is not retained within the contents of a
   flashcard. This leads to a situation when you know the meaning of a word, but are unable to correctly employ it as a
   part of your active vocabulary.
2. Properly employing explicit SRS-s by reviewing on time and following common guidelines (which unleashes their full
   potential) is an ever-growing burden of time and patience that adds up over time as your level of proficiency rises.
3. Explicit SRS-s are simply not scalable enough for the later stages of language learning (intermediate-to-advanced),
   as the amount of words you need to learn increases exponentially (for instance, it is for this reason that there is
   no Goethe B2 or C1 wordlist, it would be a whole book). You will be swamped with thousands (if not tens of thousands)
   of scheduled reviews and will have to either miss reviews, sabotaging the whole point of using an SRS, or turn to
   implicit spaced repetition.

These issues have led me to believe that there's no best type of spaced repetition system, and I recommend you to mix
them instead to get the most optimal and, what's even more crucial, persistent result. That sort of mix or ratio has
to be flexible, as your needs in terms of scalability, speed and barrier-of-entry change throughout your learning
process.

For me, it was a slow but certain transition from solely using explicit SRS to only using implicit SRS. From my
learning experience, I concluded that the most efficient combination of explicit and implicit SRS is to start out with
a regular explicit SRS like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), achieve a beginner-intermediate level and accumulate an
initial set of vocabulary to then slowly add implicit SRS-s (reading books, watching videos and so on) on top, utilizing
that launch point and start decreasing explicit SRS to drop it entirely when implicit spaced repetition becomes
fully sufficient. Though your mileage may heavily vary from the results I got.

## Conclusion

In this article, I tried to introduce the concept of spaced repetition as a whole and explained the (self-titled)
branches of it and how to achieve a happy medium between them.

My motivation behind this article was to try to rethink the way we think about vocabulary, active recall
(explicit SRS) and passive review (implicit SRS) because I have seen way too many learners lean to only one, sabotaging
the efficiency of their learning process. As I've noted various times, I believe that the best results in language
learning are yielded from a productive balance of two extremes (in this case, explicit and implicit spaced repetition).

I hope this article was helpful, and I wish you the best of luck in picking the right balance of tools and methods to
enhance your language vocabulary.
