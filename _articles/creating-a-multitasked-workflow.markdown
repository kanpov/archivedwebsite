## Introduction

This article aims to tackle the complex subject of setting up and **maintaining an efficient and productive workflow**
that employs multitasking.

I'd like to share everything I've learnt from using multitasking to empower my work, be it competitive programming,
3D art, mathematics, game programming, language learning or any time-consuming field. I've learnt from trial and error
what an inherently unproductive workflow leads to, and seen how difficult it is to develop a method that works for you personally.

As a disclaimer, I must warn you that the trade-off for making this article more practical and universal was
objectivity, so it is biased towards my own experiences. Therefore, **treat everything written here with a heavy grain
of salt**, and experiment on your own.

## An Argument in Favor of Multitasking

_To do two things at once is to do neither._\
I’m sure you’ve all heard of the saying, but is it really all there is to it? Is this disregard deserved, or is it a
 product of yet another stereotype?

Multitasking is rather complicated and has various prerequisites and implications that, when ignored, can greatly
 sabotage your productivity, motivation, mental and physical health.

However, if you manage to apply it in your life in a non-destructive and productive way, you will reap great rewards
 from doing so in terms of both your creative and professional growth.

This opinion has been proven by countless research initiatives, like Bernice Eudison's project, which studied the
 workflows of many researchers and creative people and came to the conclusion that multitasking is the foundational
part of their day-to-day workflow.

## The Hidden Cost of Productivity Apps

A lot of the time when I browse online for productivity advice online, I seem to encounter people that often tend to
obstruct their creative workflow with complexity that doesn't pay off.

Productivity-related applications and methods take up a significant portion of your time, be it creating cards in a
[Trello](https://trello.com) board, making a new note in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or filling up the calendar
and checklists on [monday.com](https://monday.com).

The sheer amount of time you'll need to invest to properly use these sorts of apps is often underestimated, and it is
 ultimately the main reason why I suggest **using a down-top approach with productivity**, meaning that you should
 introduce changes and productivity methods into your workflow only when not doing so has proven to be objectively
 detrimental to your creative process.

There are many advantages to using productivity apps, but they can take up time that you could be using to work on your
next project, and instead you spend hours (this is an exaggeration, but my point still stands) daily on creating cards,
assigning labels and making notes. The worst thing about this is that investing time into these sorts of applications
gives you a false sense of productivity, when you might just be wasting time, so **keep it as simple and lightweight
as possible** for it to still be tailored to your needs.

## The Choice of Software

As soon as you've decided that you need to use a productivity tool, the obvious next step is to choose which one.
And, frankly, there are a lot of options, like [monday.com](https://monday.com), [Trello](https://trello.com) and [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

Once you do some research, it starts seeming like there's a new shiny productivity tool popping up every day and
you need to switch to it immediately, so **it is extremely easy to get stuck in choosing and tweaking your productivity
tool**.

My advice to avoid doing this is to **try a few of the popular tools for a week each, choose one and stick with it**.
Unlike the popular belief, the little features and whistles of these tools rarely ever make a difference in your
 workflow, so you're going to be well off with any popular piece of software.

The tool I've personally chosen is **[Trello](https://trello.com)**, and that is for a few reasons:

- It is extremely lightweight and quite easy to get started
- It features a powerful foundation for architecting effective workflows based on boards, lists and cards
- It has brilliant collaboration features if you ever come to need them
- It has lots of features to help you scale up your workflow, like labels, attachments, checklists and dates
- It is incredibly versatile and universal and is actively used for famous projects

The rest of this article features Trello to demonstrate my workflow, but the techniques I employ are present
in many other major productivity tools.

## A Quick Explanation of Trello

This section aims to give you a quick understanding of the fundamental concepts of Trello. It is by no means
a complete guide to using it, so if you want to dive deeper into its features, be sure to research on your own.

- The largest organizational unit in Trello is a **workspace**. Multiple workspaces are typically only used for Trello's
  collaboration features, and you'll have one created by default.
- Inside a workspace, there are **boards**. Each board is a separate screen on its own, and boards are usually isolated
  from one another. The most popular approach to naming boards is to have one board for every project, but later in this
  article I'm going to present an alternative method.
- Every board consists of a screen with **lists**. A list contains some amount of tasks and is used to group those tasks
  together based on an organizational principle. The most basic list setup are three lists: _"To Do"_, _"In Progress"_
  and _"Done"_, but as your needs grow you'll eventually have to switch to something more robust.
- The tasks inside a list are called **cards**. A card is the most fundamental unit of information in Trello and is
  mainly used to represent some action or task. Cards have labels on them that need to give a brief description of them,
  but have other, more advanced features to add more information to them:
    - Descriptions that are (optionally Markdown-styled) more long-form explanations of the meaning of the card
    - Labels that are colorful labeled attachments to a card that give quick insights on it, like a green label "Done"
      or a red label "Urgent"
    - You can also add checklists to break down a card into smaller and typically more manageable tasks
    - A card can also contain a due date and Trello can optionally send out notifications to remind you if you're late
      on completing a card or if its due date is soon
    - You can also attach images and URLs to add external information to your card

## The Mega-map Organizational Approach

Lastly, I'd like to present my approach to organizing my Trello boards, that uses a technique I call a **mega-map**.

My motivation behind doing this was rooted in the main problem of making a board for every project (as described in the
last section): **it is hard to navigate an isolated set of projects**, especially when there are so many of them (like
for my use case). It is remarkably difficult to get a full grasp of what you need to do it, when all of your tasks are
highly divided between multiple non-interconnected places, like Trello boards.

The rather simple solution I found to work is to **put everything in a single board, where every list is a project**.
The obvious problem with that is the fact that you'll have to compress all lists in a board into a single one,
compromising on the benefits of using multiple lists for every project. In order to compress the lists without omitting
any useful information that these lists contain (like the status of the task, with the "To Do", "In Progress" and 
"Done" model), this information can be transferred into short and useful labels, so, in this case, a blue "To Do",
a yellow "In Progress" and a green "Done" label.

This method has worked wonderfully and has eliminated my main concern with multitasked workflows: getting overwhelmed
at the sheer amount of tasks and having these tasks isolated and, as a result, disorganized. Here is a visual 
representation of how this could look like:

## Conclusion

In this article, I shared some advice on productivity and multitasked workflows that I've gathered over the years and
I hope it was helpful.
Once again, the information here is inherently subjective and tied to my experience, so take it
with that in mind.
