## The Struggle to Learn Languages

**Millions of people around the world want to learn a foreign language**, whether it’d be to \
 immigrate to another country, where that language is official,
 or to communicate with friends and family or just for fun.

**The resources surrounding language learning are immense, and yet so many people struggle with it**. For instance, the vast majority of high school
 graduates in my country, where English is a mandatory school subject, are far from fluent in the language, despite studying it for 11 years straight. And
 their level of proficiency only continues to decline over the years without sufficient practice.

And what’s even more disappointing is that **the language learning industry often prioritizes revenue** over helping their customers succeed with the right
 learning mindset. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, from the sheer number of advertisements and organizations putting out labels like _“Learn 
 Spanish in 6 months”_ or _“This technique will boost your language learning process”_. And people believe and pay for it, and end up misled, disappointed
 and ready to quit.

I believe that the key to success in the language learning process lies within **perseverance and dedication, not technique**. This never-ending ocean of
 myths, challenges, personal opinions, “magic-pill” solutions, other learners’ experiences and success stories is notoriously difficult to navigate.
Inevitably, it is the biggest reason so many learners fail in achieving their goals of language fluency.

## My Experience

**I've been learning English for about 4 years and have achieved a significant level of fluency**. Over the course of my learning process, I've tried
different techniques and tips, read books and watched countless hours of content made by native English speakers. I've worked through textbooks, made
analyses and am now maintaining this English-only website, where I write long-winded posts in the newsletter every single week.

I'd like to provide my opinion and some advice to try and help every learner through this remarkably painful journey of language learning.

## Three Pairs of Extremes

For the reasons outlined above, **I'm not trying to to offer you a magical method** of learning a language, simply because I can’t and don’t know your
 learning preferences. I may only offer some advice based on my experience.

Oftentimes in language learning, **your progress might be hindered because you've chosen to follow an extreme**: only read books and immerse yourself or
 only go through textbooks; only use one learning method or overload yourself by using dozens at once.

The most important action you'll often have to do when learning is **striking a productive and comfortable balance between two given extremes** that
 works for you and fits your learning preferences. The tips below are organized to be pairs of two extreme solutions to a problem that seemingly 
 contradict one another, and it is up to you to find a happy medium between them. I've tried to remove as much bias as possible from them and make them as
 universal as possible, but be warned that all of this is inevitably influenced by my personal opinions on language learning.

### I. Seek feedback, but avoid complete reliance

It is important to seek feedback on your learning achievements and progress because **it is remarkably difficult to track your progress in learning a language**
 if you're not already an expert at that language. The most convenient and popular way to do this is with the help of a language tutor, so I'd
 highly recommend paying for one. They will point you in the right direction and strengthen your weak points.

However, it is equally important to **avoid relying on a single learning method or the method that someone else has offered you**.
 Try out different tools and approaches to see what suits you best and yields the best result in the most effective way. No teacher, language course
 or expert can do that for you.

For the entirety of my English learning journey, I had a tutor or a teacher at school before I decided to go into it further on my own. I think a lot of
learners devalue the help they receive from their teachers. They suggest textbooks, (if you're not among a large group of students) change the learning
program to patch up holes in your knowledge and revise.

Although, I noticed that especially after I had achieved an intermediate level of proficiency, mixing and experimenting with learning styles and techniques
 became more and more important and efficient for me to advance my skills further and gain more language experience than working my way through a 
 textbook. I think this is a prime example of how different approaches become more relevant throughout the learning journey, whereas others lose their
  efficacy.

### II. Try to make it more fun, but learn to persevere

No matter which methods you use in order to learn a language, you will inevitably face major issues with motivation. Learning a language is difficult, so
 this is completely normal.

To combat this, I suggest you find a way to **make the process more relevant to your life and generally more engaging**. For instance, I started learning
German as my third language last September, and I’ve been watching simple cooking recipes in German, since I want to learn how to cook.

There are many ways, in which you can improve your motivation to learn a language, and yet **sometimes there is no other choice other than to persevere**.
The worst difference from learning many other skills is that progress is so slow, and it only gets worse with time.
Therefore, it is no surprise that many learners regularly want to quit.

### III. Immerse yourself in the language, but supervise the process

I'm sure you've heard enough that **immersion is crucial to learning a language**. And, while I completely agree with that statement, there is some debate
around what immersion truly means. It is commonly stated that the best way to immerse yourself in a language is by visiting the state in which that
 language is spoken. However, that is not nearly the only way to achieve immersion.
 
From the very beginning, it’s good practice to **try and communicate with other people using your target language**. As you achieve a minimal comfortable level in the language, **try reading books, watching videos and podcasts**. It can make learning more satisfying and is, undoubtedly, key to achieving fluency.

However, I'd argue it is also important to **take responsibility and supervise the process of doing so**. Focus your attention deliberately on the words
 and grammar forms native speakers use in their speech. When reading a book, look up new words in the dictionary and pay special attention as soon as you
encounter them again, and so on.

I've watched countless videos and documentaries on YouTube, read at this point probably a few hundreds of books and slowly developed an immersive learning
approach that works for me: I try to pick a series of 3 or more books that I'm invested in and iteratively read through them dozens of times (the amount
 of re-reads depends on the difficulty of the books), slowly accumulating new vocabulary. I've also noticed that I was able to pick up even some grammar
 in an intrinsic way while doing this. For example, I only managed to understand the Past Perfect tense once I analyzed the hundreds of times the tense
 was used in literature and why the author had chosen to use it.

## An Indecisive Conclusion

I wish learning a language was as simple as being given a few tips and seeing them magically work out, but it isn't.

I've tried to share some relatively universal language learning ideas and some of my own experience and point out what I think is one of the greatest
reasons why so many struggle, but, at the end of the day, all I can do is try to point you in the direction I believe is right.

I hope this article was in some way useful to you and I wish you the best of luck on your language learning journey!
