## Introduction

**This article aims to tackle the broad subject of journaling**, the concept of journaling your work, the benefits of
doing so and the ways you could set up such a workflow. I also try to share some of my experience with journaling in
general and explain how it led to my current approach to journaling on this website.

As a disclaimer, **this article only presents a specific and isolated way to approach journaling** and writing that very
well may not be applicable in the context of your goals, writing style and personal preferences. I can only share what
has worked for me and hope that it will be useful to others trying to rethink their journaling mindset.

## My Experience with Journaling

### I. Starting to Journal

My first attempts at journaling lasted only a few days each, as I failed to recognize the point of journaling, hence
failing to successfully integrate it into my daily routine.

The first time I managed to actually start journaling was at the beginning of September 2021. Back at that time, I was
recommended an excellent note-taking software called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and quickly started integrating it
into my life as a storage for study notes, project documentation among other things. As I dove deeper into the
note-taking rabbit-hole, I encountered a practice called "daily notes", which essentially implies writing up a note
(journal entry) every day.

I started making **short, concise daily notes** every evening after spending all of my prior free time working on my mod
projects. In the notes, I outlined in 2-4 paragraphs my key achievements for the day, which wasn't much, considering I
only had 2-3 hours of free time at best every work day. It was incredibly fulfilling to look back on even the smallest
accomplishments, plan forward and act on those plans, slowly getting closer to the project's completion. As short as
those notes were, they sparked my interest in writing in English and the size of the posts gradually grew alongside
**noticeable productivity and motivation gains** ([September 9th](/cdn/20220816/DailyNote20210909.png) and
[October 22nd](/cdn/20220816/DailyNote20211022.png)).

### II. Benefits of Journaling

Firstly, **journaling sparked my interest in writing in English** in general. Before writing daily notes, the only real
writing practice I got were the short writing exercises in the books I had used at the time, and that didn't give me
much freedom in terms of what I was able to write. Daily writing turned out much less difficult than I had initially
anticipated, helped me practice writing in an engaging way, and it overall increased my satisfaction with learning the 
language.

Secondly, **journaling helped me develop my planning and time management skills**, as I had to look back, write my
progress and plan forward, not letting me lose track of my goals and projects. This is best proven by the fact that
during the half-year or so I journaled that way I managed to finish and release more projects than in the 1.5 years
prior. This knowledge has proven immensely useful in succeeding with my studies, projects and competitions.

Lastly, **journaling heavily increased my motivation for working on larger, long-term projects**. Lack of motivation was
the primary reason why I abandoned more than half of my projects. The initial boost doesn't last long enough for more
long-term projects, and self-contemplating on even the smallest of achievements in my journal every day
filled that gap, allowing me to move forward with more ambitious goals and projects.

### III. Struggling with Consistency

It was going great, until I encountered my biggest roadblock to continuing the journal: **the ever-growing time burden**.
For the first month or two, I had plenty of time at my disposal to crank out even the largest daily notes, but it all
started to change as I sunk deeper into a year-long game development competition and was forced to dedicate almost all
of my free time to preparing for the next round. The frequency of my posts declined, so I switched to making weekly
notes, but constantly shifted the schedule back and forth as my time budget and motivation grew and declined.

In late November, I was getting tired of this never-ending process and found out about an incredibly simple command-line
program called [jrnl.sh](https://jrnl.sh) that granted me more freedom and dynamism in my journaling schedule. The way
it works is simple: type `jrnl {sentence}` into the command-line (where _{sentence}_ is a new fact or achievement), and
it will log the sentence into a plain-text journal file alongside the exact date and time. The program provides various
extra features, like powerful filtering and search capabilities, starred sentences and tags, so it suited my needs best
at the time.

My schedule loosened in January and February 2022, but in March I was forced to dedicate almost all of my time to
preparing for the final round of the competition, so **I quit journaling for a few months and decided to rethink my
approach**.

## My Approach to Journaling

### I. The Issue with Consistent Journaling

In May 2022, I finally had enough free time and was thinking about how I could start journaling again. But this time I
was determined to work out a method of journaling that would be sustainable over a longer period of time.

After contemplating over my experience with journaling, I realized that **the main issue** causing me to switch methods
every few months **was the enforced consistency in my journaling output**, be it every day, week, month or any other
schedule I forced upon myself.

This was entirely unsustainable and stressful in the long-term since **it is impossible to maintain a constant standard
of progress** and productivity over a long period of time, which is especially relevant when not working full-time. 
That's why I think consistency is only harmful to any chances your journaling efforts have of staying for good.

### II. Introducing Work-Oriented Journaling

I have developed a new approach that I call **work-oriented journaling**. A work journal is solely focused on
compounding, writing out and looking back at your work. It isn't meant to be consistent, but rather directly correlated
to the work you are able to make.

A work journal is meant to **cultivate work ethic**, increase productivity, develop motivation, encourage discipline and
responsibility in the context of heavily multitasked workloads, where getting lost under the burden of various
concurrent projects is only a matter of time.

Not even the best productivity tool can fight that reoccurring feeling of emptiness that tears you apart from inside.
_"Why am I doing this?"_, _"What have I accomplished?"_, _"What am I really working towards?"_ are the questions that a
work journal makes you constantly answer by recollecting, summarizing, looking back and ahead. Having a strong
foundation, a sense of meaning is invaluable to completing your projects and achieving your goals.

### III. Combining Journaling and Productivity Tools

As I've noted previously, a journal is incredibly useful for cultivating a better work ethic and increasing productivity
and motivation. However, for bigger projects and goals this effect can be greatly amplified with **a dedicated
productivity and planning tool**. A planning tool is designed to organize your tasks in a neat, coherent manner to plan
your projects forward and keep track of your tasks to later write them down in your work journal.

on creating and maintaining an efficient multitasked workflow suited best for your needs. 

## Setting Up a Work Journal

To demonstrate how a work journal may look like, I'm going to provide the example of my own work journal that is hosted
on this website - [the newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

### I. Creating a Public Journal Online

**The first option for creating a work journal is to host it on a website online**, like the
[newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}) I have on this website. This is a great option if you want to make your
journal freely available on the Internet to potentially reach a wider audience or just show it to your friends.

The hardest part about creating a public journal is making the actual website. If you aren't a professional web
developer, the easiest and most convenient option is using a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

A static site generator (SSG) operates on different types of text files and transforms
them into special web files like HTML, CSS and JavaScript that then will be deployed onto a domain name. You can buy
a domain, or you can use a free hosting provider like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) that will do the hard
work of getting your content to the Internet for you.

In Jekyll, the input file format is called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), a robust and
easy-to-use markup language that allows you to write and style your text without using a proprietary format like
Microsoft Word's `.docx`. This means that your writing will be entirely future-proof, as Markdown is just a simple text
file with extra syntax on top. To get a grasp of what Markdown looks like, see what
[this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kanpov/kanpov.github.io/main/_articles/journaling-to-cultivate-work-ethic.markdown)
looks like before being processed by Jekyll.

To learn more about Jekyll's features and get started with your website, check out [its documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

### II. Creating a Private Journal Offline

If you are concerned about the privacy of your writing or would like to add personal information to your journal,
**another great option is writing out your journal privately on your desktop**. This approach is much simpler, as it
doesn't involve any special tools or generators, like Jekyll, and offers you complete freedom of technique.

I personally dislike handwritten journals, as they are slow to write, messy to maintain and, in my experience, provide
no real benefit over a digital workflow, but your mileage may vary.

If you prefer to take the digital route, I'd suggest using Markdown as your primary format too. There are hundreds
of different Markdown editors, but by far the most beginner-friendly is [Typora](https://typora.io/) and the most
advanced is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). A lighter alternative may also be [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/),
that offers an experience that is very close to writing in Notepad or Notepad++.

Having your journal in a folder somewhere on your computer is lightweight and simplistic, but it's also important to
back your journal up so as not to lose your files in an unforeseen event. There are numerous tools that will back up
your journal, I suggest using [SyncFolder](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/syncfolder/9NC73MJWHSWW?hl=en-us&gl=US),
a piece of software that copies (synchronizes) the content of a directory to various other locations.

As soon as you've got a directory, a Markdown editor installed and a backup workflow set up, you're ready to start
writing in your private journal.

### III. Advice for Maintaining a Work Journal

**Work journaling is fundamentally volatile**. Your journal should only be based on your will to write and the progress
you manage to make, not on the schedule you want to establish. Setting goals and standards is generally beneficial, but
I believe it only hinders your journaling and writing in general, making you sacrifice quality to keep up with an
imaginary schedule.

My personal rule is to release a new post as soon as I have enough work that I'm proud enough of to write about and
show off. Such an approach in combination with a passion for writing would establish a relationship between your volume
of progress and ability to write, adding another factor to boost your motivation.

**A work journal can also be versioned** to keep track of changes you make to your writing style and encourage those
changes to be made when needed. I suggest using an `f.n` versioning system, where `f` is the format version and `n`
is the number of the post (for example, in my latest post at the time I'm writing this is 1.10, where `f`=1 and `n`=10).
Since work journals are volatile, a versioning system can help you record your journal's evolution over time.

## Conclusion

In this article, I briefly summarized my experience with journaling consistently and the benefits that a journal may
provide, introduced the concept of a work-oriented journal and explained a few methods to create your own work journal.

I hope this information was useful to you, and I wish you the best of luck in maintaining or starting your journal.
